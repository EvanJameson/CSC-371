In our game you play as a new employee to the company, Animaly, that has turned into a rat
and must explore to find a cure for himself. Along the way, the player can shapeshift and turn into numerous
different animals to overcome obstacles they encounter.

In this prototype, we have most of the levels for our rat. After discussing the gameplay with you, we will most likely
shorten the time that the player spends with just the rat, and introduce the cat and other animal levels much earlier to make gameplay more fun.
We want to give the player more opportunities for meaningful play as soon as possible. 

We have a game manager which is not destroyed upon loading each level which maintains our character scripts and the audio manager.

Our main menu is working with a level selector, and a persistent save file which exists upon exiting the game. 

During this iteration, we put a large amount emphasis on creating a cohesive story. To accomplish that, we implemented a system to pick up journal pages that will
gradually reveal elements of our story to the player. The majority of the journal entries have also been written and are included as a document (but have not all been integrated
into our game).
